# A combination of GC content and CG dinucleotide frequency as a risk assessment factor for sustained transmission of avian influenza A virus in mammals

+ Data and materials used in this study includes the phylogenetic trees of eight protein coding regions, the summary of statistics for genomic GC content, CG frequency and SVM model files.

+ The developed SVM model is available at http://sustained-transmission-yt-web.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.

+ The Influenza A virus genomic data are downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/).
