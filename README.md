# Genomic insights into sustained mammalian transmission of avian influenza A viruses

+ Data and materials used in this study include the phylogenetic trees of eight protein coding regions and H5 gene for recently emerging H5Nx, the summary of statistics for genomic GC content, GC dinucleotide frequency and SVM model files.

+ The developed SVM model is available at https://iav-transmission.org/.

+ The Influenza A virus genomic data are downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/).
